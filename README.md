# NUMINOUS

## About Numinous
/ˈnü-mə-nəs/ adjective: an experience that leaves one fearful yet fascinated, awed yet attracted, overwhelmed yet inspired. Our app is a visual experience, allowing users to explore the roads less traveled by discovering unsung destinations the world over. The Numinous home page immediately invites exploration by presenting an enticing photo gallery of these destinations with no labels. Users can click on the photos that they’re drawn to to learn more about that destination, including high level attributes that help define the experience that destination offers.

At the heart of the Numinous is the My Epic page. Registered users can add any location to their own list of dream destinations to create a scrapbook of travel goals, or edit that list as they wish. When users create a robust My Epic page, they’ll start to understand what they are looking for in their next vacation. They can then go back to the home page and filter the opening gallery by attributes that are important to them, and continue to build their own Epic.
