//                         At the heart of the Numinous is the My Epic page. As a registered user, you can add any location to your own list of dream destinations to create a scrapbook of travel goals, or edit that list by removing saved desinations. Once a robust My Epic page is created, an understanding of what is important in your next vacation will begin to materialize. Return to the home page and filter the opening gallery by attributes to continue to build your own Epic.</p>
